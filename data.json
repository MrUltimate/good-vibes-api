Anthony, a leader of the women's suffrage movement who was arrested for illegally voting in 1872.\nMr. Trump announced the full pardon for Anthony during the signing of a proclamation commemorating the 100th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment, which guaranteed women the right to vote.\nMr. Trump's grant of clemency to Anthony comes as he struggles to gain support from women voters.\nObama, who delivered the keynote address, lambasted Mr. Trump in her speech, saying he \"cannot meet this moment\" and is unfit to serve a second term.\nWhen asked to respond to Obama's speech, Mr. Trump said she was \"over her head\" and called the remarks \"divisive.\"",
